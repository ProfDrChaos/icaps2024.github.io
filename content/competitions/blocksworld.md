# 2024 Blocksworld Challenge

To pass the time during the ICAPS 2024 banquet (buffet means waiting in line), we launched the official "Blocks Building Competition" (unofficially the Blocksworld Challenge). Tables were invited to collaborate and build epic structures throughout the night, and compete in one of three tracks. Below are the presentation results for each of them. Congrats to all the winning tables! (who got to take home a pack of blocks each, of course!)

## Track #1: Tallest Tower
Measured in the number of blocks high (roughly), this track had tables building the tallest tower they could.
